Want scripts/code blocks to do the following
- load packages
- import data
- tidy and prepare data
- analyses
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 

concept for naming scripts:
“##_name_v#” 
## - indicates the order that the scripts should be run in
“name” - is a descriptor
“v#” - indicates the version number
ex: 00_packages_v1.r 01_dataclean_v1.r

Things to consider
! Is "max temp" the best indicator of heat stress
  - Maybe "time above x" is better
  - time OTCs spent x deviations above the control mean or something like that
! HOBOs
  - need to remove extreme temperature spikes
! Wanted to figure out the phenological index
! How do I work with the temporal angle of my plant data

Analysis
Treatments
 - something along the lines of a two sample t test for temp stats of OTC vs CON


Linear Modelling
Number Missing ~ Max Temp
- Need to make a dataframe that includes
